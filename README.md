# Smart Fish Feeding System (SFFS)

## Overview
The **Smart Fish Feeding System (SFFS)** is an IoT-based project designed to automate fish feeding and water level management for aquariums. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control a servo motor for feeding and a water pump based on water level readings. The system integrates with the **Blynk IoT platform** for remote monitoring and control via a mobile app.

## Features
- **Water Level Monitoring**: Measures water level using a sensor and displays it on the Blynk app.
- **Automatic Pump Control**: Turns the pump on/off based on a predefined water level threshold (30%).
- **Servo Motor Control**: Remotely controls a servo motor to dispense food via the Blynk app.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays water level, pump status, and servo angle on the Blynk app.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **Water Level Sensor** (connected to GPIO32)
- **Water Pump** (connected to GPIO25)
- **Servo Motor** (connected to GPIO2)
- **WiFi Network** (for Blynk connectivity)

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 board support
- **Blynk Library** (`BlynkSimpleEsp32`)
- **ESP32Servo Library** (`ESP32Servo`)
- **Blynk Mobile App** (configured with the provided template and auth token)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the water level sensor to GPIO32.
   - Connect the water pump to GPIO25.
   - Connect the servo motor to GPIO2.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and powered appropriately.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the required libraries (`BlynkSimpleEsp32` and `ESP32Servo`) in the Arduino IDE.
   - Update the WiFi credentials in the code:
     ```cpp
     char ssid[] = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
     char pass[] = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
     ```
   - Use the provided Blynk credentials:
     ```cpp
     #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "TMPL66oRUJVkd"
     #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "SFFS Project"
     #define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "cCVBzGw1d2IJmjAJb5YNoR3gW3dl5JAV"
     ```

3. **Blynk App Configuration**:
   - Create a new project in the Blynk app using the provided template ID and auth token.
   - Add the following widgets:
     - **Slider** (Virtual Pin V0): To control the servo angle (0-180Â°).
     - **Gauge** (Virtual Pin V1): To display the servo angle.
     - **Gauge** (Virtual Pin V2): To display the water level percentage.
     - **Text Display** (Virtual Pin V3): To show the pump status (ON/OFF).

4. **Upload the Code**:
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to verify the connection to Blynk and WiFi.

5. **Testing**:
   - Ensure the ESP32 connects to the WiFi and Blynk server.
   - Use the Blynk app to control the servo motor and monitor water level and pump status.
   - Verify the pump turns on when the water level is below 30% and off when above.

## Code Explanation
- **Libraries**:
  - `WiFi.h`: For WiFi connectivity.
  - `BlynkSimpleEsp32.h`: For Blynk IoT platform integration.
  - `ESP32Servo.h`: For controlling the servo motor.
- **Pin Definitions**:
  - `WATER_SENSOR_PIN` (GPIO32): Reads water level.
  - `PUMP_PIN` (GPIO25): Controls the water pump.
  - `SERVO1_PIN` (GPIO2): Controls the servo motor.
  - `THRESHOLD` (30%): Water level threshold for pump activation.
- **Main Functions**:
  - `setup()`: Initializes Serial, Blynk, servo, and pin modes.
  - `loop()`: Runs Blynk, reads water level, updates Blynk app, and controls the pump.
  - `BLYNK_WRITE(V0)`: Handles servo angle input from the Blynk app.

## Usage
- **Monitor Water Level**: Check the water level percentage in the Blynk app (V2).
- **Control Feeding**: Use the slider in the Blynk app (V0) to adjust the servo angle for feeding.
- **Pump Status**: View the pump status (ON/OFF) in the Blynk app (V3).

## Troubleshooting
- **WiFi Connection Issues**: Verify WiFi credentials and signal strength.
- **Blynk Connection Issues**: Ensure the correct auth token and template ID are used.
- **Sensor Issues**: Check water sensor connections and calibration.
- **Servo Issues**: Ensure the servo is properly connected and powered.
